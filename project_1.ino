// Pin 10 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// give it a name:
int ledPin = 10;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
        // initialize the digital pin as an output.
        pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
        digitalWrite(ledPin,HIGH);        // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
        delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
        digitalWrite(ledPin,LOW);         // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
        delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
